
My master learning plan as thus:

1) Read some content/tutorial or watch some video
2) practice said content
3) summarize content with writting in my own words to cement key takeaways

Rinse and Repeat

For testing book code, change folders to only have the js file 
in them as a module. In the index.js, import the module and call the js file code.

This way specific logic is kept to the named folders and a standardized way of 
testing the calls is established.
